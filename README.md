# weather-journal-app


This project runs on a local server. It uses Node. If you don't have Node already installed on your machine, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

You also must have an API key for OpenWeatherMap.org. The sign-up page is [here](https://openweathermap.org/).

After you get your API key, go to the file config-sample.js in the website folder. Here you should replace the dummy API key with your own. Then rename the file to config.js.

# Installation

If Node is installed, then you can use the Node Package Manager to install the packages needed to run this program, which are listed in the package.json file. In the terminal, use this command:

# npm install

When those packages have installed, start the server with the following command.

node server.js
